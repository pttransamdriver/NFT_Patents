# üîí Security Guide

This document outlines the security measures, best practices, and procedures for the NFT Patents project.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Architecture

### Smart Contract Security

#### Access Control
- **Ownable Pattern**: Critical functions restricted to contract owner
- **Role-Based Access**: Authorized spenders for token operations
- **Multi-signature Support**: Recommended for mainnet deployment

#### Protection Mechanisms
- **Reentrancy Guards**: All payment functions protected
- **Pausable Contracts**: Emergency stop functionality
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive parameter checking
- **Overflow Protection**: Using Solidity 0.8+ built-in checks

#### Economic Security
- **Supply Limits**: PSP token has maximum supply cap
- **Price Controls**: Owner-only price update functions
- **Balance Checks**: Prevent operations exceeding user balances

### Frontend Security

#### API Key Management
- User API keys stored in localStorage only
- Never transmitted to backend servers
- Clear privacy messaging in UI
- Option to clear stored keys

#### Input Sanitization
- All user inputs validated before processing
- Patent number format validation
- Search query sanitization

#### External API Security
- Request timeouts implemented
- Rate limiting considerations
- Error handling without exposing sensitive data

## üîß Security Tools & Testing

### Static Analysis Tools

#### Slither
```bash
npm run security:slither
```
- Detects common vulnerabilities
- Analyzes contract interactions
- Generates detailed reports

#### Solhint
```bash
npm run security:solhint
```
- Enforces coding standards
- Identifies potential issues
- Maintains code quality

### Testing Strategy

#### Security Test Suite
```bash
npx hardhat test test/Security.test.cjs
```

Tests cover:
- Access control violations
- Reentrancy attacks
- Input validation
- Economic exploits
- Pause functionality

#### Coverage Analysis
```bash
# Note: Coverage analysis tools removed in Hardhat v3 upgrade
# Use alternative tools or manual testing for coverage analysis
```

## üö® Security Procedures

### Pre-Deployment Checklist

#### Smart Contracts
- [ ] All tests passing (including security tests)
- [ ] Slither analysis clean
- [ ] Solhint compliance
- [ ] Gas optimization review
- [ ] Access control verification
- [ ] Pause functionality tested

#### Frontend
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] API key handling secure
- [ ] No sensitive data in client code
- [ ] HTTPS enforced
- [ ] Content Security Policy configured

#### Infrastructure
- [ ] Environment variables secured
- [ ] Private keys in secure storage
- [ ] RPC endpoints configured
- [ ] Monitoring systems active

### Incident Response

#### Emergency Procedures
1. **Pause Contracts**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/emergency/pauseAll.js --network mainnet
   ```

2. **Withdraw Funds**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/emergency/withdrawFunds.js --network mainnet
   ```

3. **Update Contract Addresses**
   - Deploy new contracts if needed
   - Update frontend configuration
   - Notify users of changes

#### Communication Plan
- Immediate notification to users
- Status page updates
- Social media announcements
- Technical post-mortem

### Monitoring & Alerts

#### On-Chain Monitoring
- Large token transfers
- Unusual contract interactions
- Failed transactions patterns
- Gas price anomalies

#### Off-Chain Monitoring
- API rate limiting breaches
- Unusual user behavior
- System performance metrics
- Error rate monitoring

## üîê Best Practices

### Development
- Use latest OpenZeppelin contracts
- Follow Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern
- Implement comprehensive testing
- Regular security audits

### Deployment
- Use hardware wallets for mainnet
- Multi-signature for critical operations
- Gradual rollout strategy
- Monitoring from day one

### Operations
- Regular security reviews
- Dependency updates
- Backup procedures
- Incident response drills

## üìã Security Audit History

### Internal Audits
- **Date**: [Current Date]
- **Scope**: Smart contracts, frontend, infrastructure
