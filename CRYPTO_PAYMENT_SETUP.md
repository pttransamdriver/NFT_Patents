This guide will help you set up cryptocurrency payments using MetaMask for your AI search feature.

## üéØ **Payment Options Now Available**

### **Option 1: MetaMask Payment (NEW!)**
- Users pay with ETH directly from MetaMask

- No processing fees (except gas)

### **Option 2: Credit Card Payment**

## üöÄ **Quick Setup (15 minutes)**

### Step 1: Set Up Your Wallet Address
1. **Get your wallet address** where you want to receive payments
2. **Add to environment variables**:
   ```env
   VITE_PAYMENT_RECIPIENT_ADDRESS=0xYourWalletAddressHere
   ```

### Step 2: Deploy Payment Contract (Optional but Recommended)
1. **Compile the contract**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. **Deploy to testnet first**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deployPayment.js --network sepolia
   ```

3. **Add contract address to .env**:
   ```env
   VITE_PAYMENT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xYourContractAddressHere
   ```

### Step 3: Test the Integration
1. **Start your backend**:
   ```bash
   cd backend && npm run dev
   ```

2. **Start your frontend**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test MetaMask payment**:
   - Go to Patent Search page
   - Click "AI Assistant"
   - Select "Integrated AI Search" tab
   - Choose "MetaMask" payment method
   - Complete test transaction

## üí∞ **Payment Flow**

### **Direct Transfer Method (Simple)**
1. User clicks "Pay with MetaMask"
2. MetaMask opens with transaction details
3. User confirms transaction
4. ETH is sent directly to your wallet
5. Backend adds 3 search credits to user account

### **Smart Contract Method (Advanced)**
1. User interacts with deployed contract
2. Contract handles payment logic
3. Automatic refunds for overpayment
4. Event logs for better tracking
5. Owner can withdraw funds anytime

## üîß **Configuration Options**

### **Environment Variables**
```env
# Required: Your wallet address for receiving payments
VITE_PAYMENT_RECIPIENT_ADDRESS=0xYourWalletAddressHere

# Optional: Smart contract address (if using contract method)
VITE_PAYMENT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xYourContractAddressHere

# Backend URL
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

### **Price Configuration**
The system automatically fetches current ETH price from CoinGecko API:
- **USD Amount**: $15.00 (configurable)
- **ETH Amount**: Calculated dynamically
- **Fallback Price**: 1 ETH = $2000 (if API fails)

## üõ°Ô∏è **Security Features**

### **Transaction Verification**
- Frontend verifies transaction success
- Backend logs all transactions
- Blockchain provides immutable record

### **Error Handling**
- User rejection: Graceful error message
- Insufficient funds: Clear error explanation
- Network issues: Automatic retry suggestions

### **Gas Optimization**
- Standard ETH transfer: 21,000 gas
- Smart contract: ~50,000 gas
- Gas price estimation included

## üìä **Business Benefits**

### **Cost Comparison**
| Payment Method | Your Cost | User Experience |
|---------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **MetaMask** | 0% fees | Instant, crypto-native |
| **Stripe** | 2.9% + $0.30 | Familiar, card-based |

### **Revenue Impact**
- **MetaMask**: Keep 100% of payment (minus gas)
- **Stripe**: Keep ~95% of payment
- **Higher margins** with crypto payments

## üé® **User Experience**

### **Payment Method Selection**
Users see both options clearly:
- **MetaMask button**: Shows ETH amount and current USD value
- **Card button**: Shows $15.00 USD
- **Real-time ETH price** updates

### **Transaction Feedback**
- **Processing**: "Confirming Transaction..."
- **Success**: Shows transaction hash
- **Error**: Clear error message with solution

## üîç **Testing Checklist**

### **Testnet Testing**
- [ ] Deploy contract to Sepolia testnet
- [ ] Test MetaMask payment flow
- [ ] Verify credits are added correctly
- [ ] Test error scenarios (rejection, insufficient funds)
- [ ] Check transaction verification

### **Mainnet Preparation**
- [ ] Deploy to mainnet
- [ ] Update contract address in .env
- [ ] Test with small amounts first
- [ ] Monitor gas prices
- [ ] Set up transaction monitoring

## üö® **Important Notes**

### **Gas Fees**
- Users pay gas fees (typically $5-20 on Ethereum)
- Consider Layer 2 solutions (Polygon, Arbitrum) for lower fees
- Gas fees are separate from your $15 payment

### **Price Volatility**
- ETH amount updates in real-time
- Users see current USD equivalent
- Consider price buffers for volatility

### **Network Support**
Currently supports:
- **Ethereum Mainnet**
- **Sepolia Testnet**
- Easy to add other networks

## üîß **Advanced Features**

### **Multi-Network Support**
Add support for other networks:
```javascript
// In cryptoPaymentService.ts
const SUPPORTED_NETWORKS = {
  1: 'Ethereum Mainnet',
  137: 'Polygon',
  42161: 'Arbitrum One'
};
```

### **Token Payments**
Extend to accept ERC-20 tokens:
- USDC for stable pricing
- Your own project token
